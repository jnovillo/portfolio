                        <p>Hello, welcome to my Professional Portfolio. My name is Jessica Novillo Argudo. I am passionate about Computer Science and Education.</p>
                        <p>I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Universidad de Cuenca in Ecuador. 
                           I have been working in New York for fourteen years as a software developer in the finance industry. 
                           I have worked on developing websites, assisting quantitative analysts in developing programs that use financial models, 
                            managing large databases and creating reports for clients.</p>
                        <p>I am currently compleating my final semester of a Master of Computer Science Education (K-12th) at Hunter College in New York, NY.</p>
                        <p>I have always had the dream to change my career and become an educator to
                            teach students what I have learned throughout my professional career. 
                            Also, I have seen New York willing to make Computer Science accessible to students of all ages (K-12th grade). 
                            This was another reason that motivated me and made me realize that it was time to get into the education field.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that my skills, all the education knowledge I have gained, and my passion for teaching would make me a good teacher.
                            I am eager to inspire new generations to immerse themselves in this modern world full of technology that is constantly evolving.
                        </p>

            <h1>My thoughts on CS education</h1>
            <p>Computers and the internet are the latest technological revolution humans have created, and many have agreed that these tools have a huge positive impact on human life. The combination of both has immensely improved communication around the world and the processing of data resulting in new inventions in medicine, agriculture, commerce, transportation, science, finance, and education, among many others.</p>
            <p>I am a firm believer that computer science education in grades K-12 is vital in today's digital world because it provides students with the necessary knowledge and skills to develop creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving that are important not only in this subject, but they also help students to stimulate their attention and improve their performance in other subjects such as math and physics. Moreover, those skills prepare students for their professional life.</p> 
            <p>Since computer science is a relatively new area in children's education, it is still limited in schools. However, I think t it will change in the short temp. For instance, over the last few years, I have seen New York willing to make Computer Science accessible to students of all school ages. Schools should definitely make efforts to ensure that all students have equal opportunities to access, learn and succeed in this field.</p>

<p>Problem 12: Lake Making [Rob Kolstad, 2008]</p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>

<p>Farmer John wants his cows to help him make a lake. He has mapped the pasture where he wants to build the lake by creating an R (3 <= R <= 100) row by C (3 <= C <= 100) column grid of six foot by six foot squares and then by determining the average elevation (10 <= elev_rc <= 5000) in inches for each square.</p>


<p>Additionally, he has trained the cows in "stomp digging". The burly bovines travel in a herd that just exactly covers a 3x3 grid of squares to a grid whose upper left coordinate is R_s,C_s (1 <= R_s <= R-2; 1 <= C_s <= C-2). The cows then stomp the ground to push it down D_s (1 <= D_s <= 40) inches. The cows are quite meticulous; the cows at lower elevations will not commence stomping until the rest of the herd has joined them. Thus, not all the 3x3 grid is necessarily stomped (or perhaps some part is stomped less than some other part).</p>


<p>Given an initial set of elevations, an ordered set of N (1 <= N <= 20000) stomp digging instructions, and an elevation E (0 <= E <= 5000) for the lake's final water level, determine the volume of water (in cubic inches) that the lake will hold. It is guaranteed that the answer will not exceed 2,000,000,000. Presume that the edge of the lake contains barriers so that water can not spill over the border.</p>
               
  
<p><b>Example</b></p>
            
<p>Consider a small 4 x 6 pasture to be turned into a lake. Its initial elevations (annotated with row/column numbers) are:</p>

<p>column: 01 02 03 04 05 06</p>
<p>row 1 : 28 25 20 32 34 36</p>
<p>row 2 : 27 25 20 20 30 34</p>
<p>row 3 : 24 20 20 20 20 30</p>
<p>row 4 : 20 20 14 14 20 20</p>
  
<p>Interpreting the map, we see a hill in the upper right corner that rises to elevation 36; a small hill also rises to elevation 28 in the upper left corner. The middle of row 4 has a slight depression. After the cow-stomping instruction "1 4 4", the pasture has these elevations:</p>

<p>column:  01 02 03 04 05 06</p>
<p>row 1 :  28 25 20 32 32 32</p>
<p>row 2 :  27 25 20 20 30 32</p>
<p>row 3 :  24 20 20 20 20 30</p>
<p>row 4 :  20 20 14 14 20 20</p>
  
<p>Note that only three squares were stomped down. The other six sets of cows were waiting for the stompers to get to their level, which never happened. After stomping down the upper left corner with this instruction "1 1 10", the pasture looks like this:</p>

<p>column:  01 02 03 04 05 06</p>
<p>row 1 :  18 18 18 32 32 32</p>
<p>row 2 :  18 18 18 20 30 32</p>
<p>row 3 :  18 18 18 20 20 30</p>
<p>row 4 :  20 20 14 14 20 20</p>
  
<p>If the final elevation of the lake is to be 22 inches, the pasture has these depths:</p>

<p>column:   1  2  3  4  5  6</p>
<p>row 1 :   4  4  4 - - -</p>
<p>row 2 :   4  4  4  2 - -</p>
<p>row 3 :   4  4  4  2  2 -</p>
<p>row 4 :   2  2  8  8  2  2</p>
  
<p>This yields a total aggregated depth of 66 inches. Calculate the volume by multiplying 66 x 6 feet x 6 feet = 66 inches x 72 inches x 72 inches = 342,144 cubic inches.</p>

<h2><b>2. SILVER</b></h2>
<p>Cow Travelling [Aram Shatakhtsyan, 2007]</p>
<p>This problem the algorithm is more difficult than the reading. You should still read it multiple times.</p>

<p>2.1 description</p>
<p>Searching for the very best grass, the cows are travelling about the pasture which is represented as a grid with N rows and M columns (2 <= N <= 100; 2 <= M <= 100). Keen observer Farmer John has recorded Bessie's position as (R1, C1) at a certain time and then as (R2, C2) exactly T (0 < T <= 15) seconds later. He's not sure if she passed through (R2, C2) before T seconds, but he knows she is there at time T.</p>

<p>FJ wants a program that uses this information to calculate an integer S that is the number of ways a cow can go from (R1, C1) to (R2, C2) exactly in T seconds. Every second, a cow can travel from any position to a vertically or horizontally neighboring position in the pasture each second (no resting for the cows). Of course, the pasture has trees through which no cow can travel.</p>

<p>Given a map with '.'s for open pasture space and '*' for trees, calculate the number of possible ways to travel from (R1, C1) to (R2, C2) in T seconds.</p>            
    
<p><b>INPUT FORMAT:</b></p>
The name of a file in the following format

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, M, and T

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes row i of the pasture with exactly M characters that are each '.' or '*'

* Line N+2: Four space-separated integers: R1, C1, R2, and C2.

<p><b>SAMPLE INPUT (file ctravel.in):</b></p>

<p><b>INPUT DETAILS:</b></p>
The pasture is 4 rows by 5 column. The cow travels from row 1, column 3 to row 1, column 5, which takes exactly 6 seconds.

<p><b>OUTPUT FORMAT:</b></p>
<p>* Line 1: A single line with the integer S described above. </p>

<p><b>SAMPLE OUTPUT</b></p>
<p>1</p>

<p><b>OUTPUT DETAILS:</b></p>
There is only one way from (1,3) to (1,5) in exactly 6 seconds (and it is the obvious one that travels around the two trees).
