## Project directions

This file lab_bank_accounts.pdf contains the directions for the inheritance project.

## Student 1 - Full level mastery

The student shows a complete understanding of inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes. The student followed the directions specified in the project requirements. Their knowledge of Java exceptions has been correctly applied in the implementation of this project. The classes are well organized. The code is clean, easy to follow, compiles with no issues, and meets the required functionalities. Their script passed all test cases.

## Student 2 - Mid level mastery

The student shows an understanding of inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes. However, the implementation is not meeting some of the lab requirements, such as:

* Interface class is present, but the abstract class in not implement the interface.
* The methods in the different classes are not throwing exceptions. Instead, exceptions are being caught.

The student's code needs to be better organized. All classes were written inside the file BankAccountInterface.java. Even though Java does not throw any exceptions, each class should be written in a different file.
